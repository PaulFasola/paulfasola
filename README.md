I'm **Paul**, a Front-End Developer working in Montreal, Canada, Earth

Currently, I find myself at [Unity](https://unity.com/), where I play a pivotal role in shaping and building the [Unity Gaming Services](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/) platform. My daily mission: ensuring our end users are thrilled while creating an environment from which over 200+ internal developers are building on daily. My tasks range is as wide as the gaming world itself â€” from core R&D to streamlining time-to-ship processes and offering rapid to long-term support, almost like internal consulting.
