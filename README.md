I‚Äôm a **Senior Software Developer** at [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/), based in Montreal, Canada, Earth. My focus is on authentication and identity, ensuring seamless and secure login experiences for millions of users across the Unity ecosystem.

## What I Do

### üîê **Identity & Authentication at Unity**

I currently lead frontend development for **[Unity Login](https://login.unity.com/)**, handling **hundreds of millions** of authentications every month. My work includes:

- **Architecting a scalable authentication model** for Unity Hub, Unity Cloud, and Unity's website.
- **Implementing secure and seamless authentication solutions**, exceeding global compliance standards.
- **Optimizing UI/UX and frontend best practices**, mentoring backend developers in modern web development.
- **Enhancing performance, security, and accessibility** through strict CSP policies, CSRF protection, and performance profiling.
- **Driving innovation** within the Identity team to improve user security and experience.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è In before, **Unity Cloud core**

Previously, I played a pivotal role in shaping and building the **[Unity Cloud](https://cloud.unity.com/)** platform. My work spanned:

- **Core R&D** to push Unity Cloud‚Äôs capabilities.
- **Streamlining time-to-ship processes**, reducing friction for internal teams.
- **Supporting over 200+ internal developers, thousands of clients**, acting as an internal consultant to improve workflows and deployment pipelines.

Always striving to **build, optimize, and innovate** and looking for new challenges! üöÄ
